# emojiconda
_An Android game built with [Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)_

I've written a blog post on a few things I've learned during this project -- take a look [here](https://nickmillward.com/android/2016/11/16/libgdx-takeaways-from-building-my-first-game).

## Game Play
- Swipe to move snake
- Snake emojis are random for every new game
- Food emojis are place randomly throughout the screen
- Earn points for every food the snake eats
- Point value increases per difficulty level
- Snake grows in length for every food it eats
- Game over when snake hits itself or the edge of the screen
